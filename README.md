# Gradebook
This Gradebook for Hl Ib computer science, it is a gradebook for teachers, students, and administrators to use


Adminstrators will first need to create an account and then, teachers and then students. 

Adminstrators can create classes, and add teachers and students to them, adminstrators can also create a list f all the Ap the students will take

Teachers, can look at all of their students in their class, and then create assignments and assign grades for every student

Teachers can also calcualte the final grade for every student

Students can look at their grades, and look at the list of Ap's that they are going to take.


In order to run it, (I will make this better) pull the src off the github repository, and import it into eclipse, and then run it

As a safety precaution all the files are stored in the %appdata% so it is not easy for students to access it without
prior knowledge of where the files are stored.
